## terraform_dynamic_blocks

This repo was created to show how to use dynamic blocks in Terraform, in this instance they are used to pass actions and not actions for a custom role creation on azure.

two variables are there that take a list of strings, so actions can be added and not actions can be added and they will be used accordingly. Its oretty straightforward

The example here is a role that has the same permissions as the Billing Reader role.
